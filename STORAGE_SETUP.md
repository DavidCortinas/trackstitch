# Supabase Storage Integration Setup Guide

This guide covers the complete setup of Supabase Storage integration for the Audafact audio application.

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented

### 1. Database Tables
- ‚úÖ `users` - Extended user profiles with access tiers
- ‚úÖ `uploads` - Audio file metadata storage
- ‚úÖ `sessions` - Session management with track IDs and metadata
- ‚úÖ `recordings` - Recording storage with session references
- ‚úÖ Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all tables
- ‚úÖ Proper indexing for performance

### 2. Storage Buckets
- ‚úÖ `user-uploads` - For user audio file uploads
- ‚úÖ `session-recordings` - For session recordings
- ‚úÖ Storage policies for secure file access
- ‚úÖ User-based folder structure

### 3. TypeScript Types
- ‚úÖ Database entity types (`User`, `Upload`, `Session`, `Recording`)
- ‚úÖ Storage types (`StorageFile`, `UploadResponse`, `DownloadResponse`)
- ‚úÖ Audio file interface (`AudioFile`)

### 4. Services
- ‚úÖ `StorageService` - File upload/download/management
- ‚úÖ `DatabaseService` - Database operations
- ‚úÖ File validation and metadata extraction
- ‚úÖ Error handling and logging

### 5. React Components
- ‚úÖ `SidePanel` - Integrated file management with drag & drop upload

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1. Upload Audio Files
The upload functionality is integrated directly into the `SidePanel` component:

```tsx
// Upload files through the SidePanel
// Navigate to "Tracks" ‚Üí "My Tracks" in the sidebar
// Click "Upload Your First Track" or drag & drop files
```

### 2. Programmatic File Operations
```tsx
import { StorageService } from './services/storageService';
import { DatabaseService } from './services/databaseService';

// Upload a file
const result = await StorageService.uploadAudioFile(file, userId, title);

// Get user's uploads
const uploads = await DatabaseService.getUserUploads(userId);

// Create a session
const session = await DatabaseService.createSession({
  user_id: userId,
  session_name: "My Session",
  track_ids: [],
  cuepoints: [],
  loop_regions: [],
  mode: "loop"
});
```

## üîß Configuration Required

### 1. Environment Variables
Make sure your `.env` file has:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url_here
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
```

### 2. Supabase Storage Policies
Run these SQL commands in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- For user-uploads bucket
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload files" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'user-uploads' AND 
    auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own files" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT USING (
    bucket_id = 'user-uploads' AND 
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own files" ON storage.objects
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    bucket_id = 'user-uploads' AND 
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own files" ON storage.objects
  FOR DELETE USING (
    bucket_id = 'user-uploads' AND 
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

-- For session-recordings bucket
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload recordings" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'session-recordings' AND 
    auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own recordings" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT USING (
    bucket_id = 'session-recordings' AND 
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own recordings" ON storage.objects
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    bucket_id = 'session-recordings' AND 
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own recordings" ON storage.objects
  FOR DELETE USING (
    bucket_id = 'session-recordings' AND 
    auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  );
```

## üîç Testing the Setup

1. **Upload a file:**
   - Navigate to your app
   - Open the SidePanel (click the hamburger menu)
   - Go to "Tracks" ‚Üí "My Tracks" 
   - Click "Upload Your First Track" or drag and drop an audio file
   - Verify it appears in the list

2. **Check database:**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Table Editor
   - Check the `uploads` table for new records
   - Verify RLS is working (only your files visible)

3. **Check storage:**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage
   - Check the `user-uploads` bucket
   - Verify files are in user-specific folders

4. **Test playback:**
   - Click play on an uploaded file
   - Verify audio controls work
   - Check that only one file plays at a time

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Invalid API key" error:**
   - Check environment variables are set correctly
   - Ensure you're using the anon key, not service role key

2. **Upload fails:**
   - Check file size (max 50MB)
   - Verify file type is supported
   - Check browser console for errors

3. **Files not visible:**
   - Verify RLS policies are set up correctly
   - Check user authentication status
   - Ensure database records were created

4. **Audio won't play:**
   - Check file URL is accessible
   - Verify CORS settings in Supabase
   - Check browser audio permissions

### Getting Help
- Check Supabase logs in the dashboard
- Review browser console for errors
- Verify all SQL commands were executed successfully
